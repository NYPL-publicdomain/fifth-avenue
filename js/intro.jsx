//   Fifth Avenue, the street that became the social and cultural spine of New York's elite, first appeared on the Commissioners' Map
//   of 1811. At that time, it was merely a country road to Yorkville (then just a tiny self-contained village), but in the proposed
//   grid plan it would be a grand boulevard. As the City grew and prospered Fifth Avenue became synonymous with fashionable life,
//   the site of mansions, cultural and social institutions, and restaurants and shops catering to the elite.

//   In 1907, alarmed at the approach of factories, the leading merchants and residents formed the Fifth Avenue Association.
//   The <i>Save New York Committee</i> became a bulwark against the wrong kind of development. Perhaps inspired by this contemporary
//   movement, photographer Burton Welles used a wide-angled view camera in 1911 to document this most important street from
//   <a>Washington Square</a>, north to <a>East 93rd Street</a>.
