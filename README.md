_Street View, Then & Now: New York City's Fifth Avenue is_ a [public domain remix](http://publicdomain.nypl.org) by [Bert Spaan](https://twitter.com/bertspaan) of [NYPL Labs](http://labs.nypl.org), using the [Fifth Avenue from Start to Finish collection](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/fifth-avenue-new-york-from-start-to-finish#/?tab=about) from 1911, it lets you compare the photos from this collection with
2015's [Google Street View](https://www.google.nl/maps/@40.7528429,-73.9813567,3a,75y,299.2h,96.54t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sFR-Gcj5IDRGxJ72fhcikWw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656).

## Data

Data comes from the [Space/Time Directory](http://spacetime.nypl.org/) Digital Collections dataset, in [Histograph](https://github.com/histograph/histograph)'s NDJSON format:

- https://github.com/nypl-spacetime/data/blob/master/digital-collections/digital-collections.pits.ndjson

This dataset contains photo UUIDs, and additional information about the photo's location and [field of view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view):

```json
{
	"id": "678a75d0-c6ca-012f-037f-58d385a7bc34",
	"type": "st:Photo",
	"data": {
		"imageId": "1113225",
		"direction": "west",
		"bearing": 298,
		"distance": 19
	},
	"geometry": {
		"type": "Point",
		"coordinates": [-73.996396, 40.732277]
	},
	"validSince": 1911,
	"validUntil": 1911
}
```

With Space/Time's [field-of-view](https://github.com/nypl-spacetime/field-of-view) module, we can convert this dataset to a GeoJSON file containing [field of view geometries](data/fields-of-view.json):

### About the NYPL Public Domain Release

On January 6, 2016, The New York Public Library enhanced access to public domain items in Digital Collections so that everyone has the freedom to enjoy and reuse these materials in almost limitless ways. For all such items the Library now makes it possible to download the highest resolution images available directly from the Digital Collections website.

That means more than 187,000 items free to use without restriction! But we know that 180K of anything is a lot to get your head around â€” so as a way to introduce you to these collections and inspire new works, NYPL Labs developed a suite of projects and tools to help you explore the vast collections and dive deep into specific ones.

Go forth & re-use; apply for our Remix Residency; and let us know what you made with the [#nyplpd hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23nyplpd). For more info, links to our projects and more, visit:
